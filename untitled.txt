Piece parent class which contains the functionality common to all pieces

key method of Piece is #moves, which should return an array of places a Piece can move to

subclasses for SlidingPiece and SteppingPiece

SlidingPiece class can implement #moves, but it needs to know what directions a piece can move in (diagonal, horizontally/vertically, both)

implement a method #move_dirs, which SlidingPiece#moves

Piece will need to (1) track its position and (2) hold a reference to the Board

SlidingPiece in particular needs the Board so it knows to stop sliding when blocked by another piece

setup the board on initialize

Each position in the board either holds a Piece, or nil

method #in_check?(color) that returns whether a player is in check

#move(start, end_pos) method. This should update the 2d grid and also the moved piece's position

raise an exception if: (a) there is no piece at start or (b) the piece cannot move to end_pos
